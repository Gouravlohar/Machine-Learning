# Web Scraping with Beautiful Soup

This repository provides a simple example of web scraping using Beautiful Soup, a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. Web scraping is the process of extracting information from websites by fetching and parsing the HTML code. Beautiful Soup makes this task easier by providing Pythonic idioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-scraping-beautiful-soup.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd web-scraping-beautiful-soup
```

3. Run the `web_scraper.py` script:

```bash
python web_scraper.py
```

This script demonstrates a basic web scraping scenario by fetching data from a sample website and extracting relevant information using Beautiful Soup.
